# Sequel Academy
High School Database Management System

The goal was to create a school (academic) database at SEQUEL Academy, to track student, staff and performance and properly manage academic and administrative data across multiple departments.

The dataset was organised into multiple tables in a relational database, including staff, class, students, hod, subjects, js_broadsheet, and ss_broadsheet. This dataset comprised extensive records for 90 students, 29 staff members, 30 disciplines, and performance data at both junior and senior levels using SQL for complicated queries, Python for data processing, and predictive modelling.
